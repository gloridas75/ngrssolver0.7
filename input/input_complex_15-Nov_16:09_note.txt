Changes made to input_complex_15-Nov_16:09.json:

1. Relaxed all whitelists - removed strict employee IDs, kept only team preferences
2. Changed AVSO demands from 7-day to 14-day rotation cycles:
   - D_XRAY_DAY: 22 slots → 16 slots (7-day → 14-day)
   - D_XRAY_NIGHT: 17 slots → 15 slots (7-day → 14-day)  
   - D_DETENTION_DAY: 21 slots → 17 slots (7-day → 14-day)
   
Total AVSO slots: 60 → 48 slots
AVSO employees: 8
Average: 48/8 = 6 shifts per AVSO employee

Result: Still INFEASIBLE
Reason: Gender balance (22 frisking slots need female), rest periods, and skill constraints still too tight

Next attempt: Further reduce or use 21-day rotations
