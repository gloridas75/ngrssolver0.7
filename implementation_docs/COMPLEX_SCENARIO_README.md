## Usage

To test this scenario with the solver:

```bash
cd /Users/glori/1 Anthony_Workspace/My Developments/NGRS/ngrs-solver-v0.5/ngrssolver

# Via CLI
python debug_solver.py input/input_complex_scenario.json

# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/solve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @input/input_complex_scenario.json
```

## Output File

When solved, output is saved to:
- `output/output_complex_DDMM_HHMM.json`
- Complete solution with 281 assignments
- File size: ~180 KB

## Notes

- **Coverage Goal**: 66.9% of total slots filled in optimal solution
- **Feasibility**: Multiple constraints create realistic scheduling challenges
- **Performance**: Solver achieves OPTIMAL in milliseconds
- **Scalability**: Demonstrates capability with realistic team complexity
- **Extensibility**: Can be enhanced with:
  - More employees (expand team sizes)
  - Additional demands (add new services)
  - Public holidays (update planningHorizon)
